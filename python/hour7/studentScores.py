# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores.
#write a program that converts their scores to grads. by the end of the program, you should have a new dictionaru called student_grades tha should contain student names for keys
#and their grades for values. the final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked. 

#do no modify the existing student_scores dictionary
#do not write any print statements. 
#scores 91-100 grade= 'outstanding'
#scores 81-90 grade='exceeds expctations
#scores 71-80 grade ='acceptable'
