                    isn't
                    quite enough, the next logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random Paragraph Generator
                    with you in
                    mind. The process is quite simple. Choose the number of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the
                    button. Your
                    chosen number of paragraphs will instantly appear.
            
                    While it may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating random paragraphs can be useful.
                    A few
                    examples of how some people use this generator are listed in the following paragraphs.</p>
